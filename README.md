# Converter-SwiftUI-version-

## This is my SwiftUI version of Converter. For the repo of my UIKit version click [here](https://github.com/steven-hill/Converter). Both projects are based on a tvOS tutorial from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/110/build-a-unit-converter-for-tvos).

### üîç More
- This app can convert distance, duration, mass, temperature or volume units.
- It has two targets - tvOS and iOS.

- The UI framework used is SwiftUI. The testing framework is XCTest for the unit tests and UI tests.
- For this app I utilised the TDD approach.
