# Converter-SwiftUI-version-

## This is my SwiftUI version of Converter. For the repo of my UIKit version click [here](https://github.com/steven-hill/Converter). Both projects are based on a tvOS tutorial from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/110/build-a-unit-converter-for-tvos).

### More
- This app can convert distance, duration, mass or temperature units. 
- It's written in Swift for tvOS 18.0 on Xcode 16.0.
- The UI framework used is SwiftUI. The testing framework is XCTest for the unit tests and UI tests.
- For this app I'm utilising the TDD approach.
